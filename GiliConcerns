- do not understand the next mechanism. at what point is the browser suppose to go there?
- should the urls end with / or not?
- all api's start with status = FAIL. is that really necessary if there is no handling for FAILING? (example api.get_post_types)
- added some logging text to settings. need to go over it
- figure out on_delete and set properly
- think about: how does a forecast work? per spot? has several spots? automatically creates a session?
- what are the conditions to auto create a session? this is an issue for both forecasts and reports. a report of 0 wind for example should not generate a session. maybe add a "rideable" flag to the report?

========================
PROBLEMS
========================
- follows field in admin looks all wrong
- comment post turns green on focus
- 404 on profile avatar

========================
ANGULAR
=======================
- correct way to handle callbacks: then \ success \ error
- should i avoid pulling stuff from the db? if i make a new post should it be brought back from db or just populate ui with local data?
- difference between ng-show and ng-if
- ng-repeat inside directive breaks inner scope and uses extrnal scope


AVATAR questions:
+ how do i give users trimming options for their images? A: UI based trimming of file. you can then upload both versions
+ how do i downsize the files? A: pillow

for production:
- login_required does not check user is_active
- csrf fucking tokens. take them off globally!
