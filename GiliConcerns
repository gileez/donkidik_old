- have a bunch of Users with no user profile. what to do?
- do not understand the next mechanism. at what point is the browser suppose to go there?
- do i care about class based views?
- in flask i worked with sessions. where are they here?
- should the urls end with / or not?
- all api's start with status = FAIL. is that really necessary if there is no handling for FAILING? (example api.get_post_types)

- added some logging text to settings. need to go over it
- figure out on_delete and set properly
- consider adding this to ?. when creating a user automatically create a user profile:
			from django.db.models import signals
			from donkidik.models import UserProfile



			def create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
			    if created:
			        UserProfile.objects.create(user=instance)


			signals.post_save.connect(create_user_profile, sender=User)
- think about: how does a forecast work? per spot? has several spots? automatically creates a session?
- what are the conditions to auto create a session? this is an issue for both forecasts and reports. a report of 0 wind for example should not generate a session. maybe add a "rideable" flag to the report?


for production:
- login_required does not check user is_active
- csrf fucking tokens. take them off globally!
