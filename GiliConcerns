- do not understand the next mechanism. at what point is the browser suppose to go there?
- should the urls end with / or not?
- all api's start with status = FAIL. is that really necessary if there is no handling for FAILING? (example api.get_post_types)
- added some logging text to settings. need to go over it
- figure out on_delete and set properly
- think about: how does a forecast work? per spot? has several spots? automatically creates a session?
- what are the conditions to auto create a session? this is an issue for both forecasts and reports. a report of 0 wind for example should not generate a session. maybe add a "rideable" flag to the report?

PROBLEMS
========================
- follows field in admin looks all wrong
- on macbook there is no call to get_posts_from_server once post has been made. WTF?

========================
ANGULAR
=======================
- should i move all functionality to angular? for example making a new post. it only appears in ui once. what is the benefit?
- correct way to handle callbacks: then \ success \ error
- should i avoid pulling stuff from the db? if i make a new post should it be brought back from db or just populate ui with local data?
- where do i insert the serialization code so that i don't need to copy paste it to every single html file?
- difference between ng-show and ng-if
- ng-disabled not working on comment text

for production:
- login_required does not check user is_active
- csrf fucking tokens. take them off globally!
