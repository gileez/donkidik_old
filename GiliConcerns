- login_required does not check user is_active
- do not understand the next mechanism. at what point is the browser suppose to go there?
- do i care about class based views?
- in flask i worked with sessions. where are they here?
- should the urls end with / or not?
- all api's start with status = FAIL. is that really necessary if there is no handling for FAILING? (example api.get_post_types)
